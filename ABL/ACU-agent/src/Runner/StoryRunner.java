/**
 * Okay, so I guess today we are going to be doing something a little bit 
 * different.
 * So, how can we break down the overall story structure the way that Josh 
 * wants me to do? Well, we know for sure that a part of the story is going 
 * to be something about the setting. However, we need to know when the setting 
 * actually becomes a Milieu story. So, that means that Milieu stories 
 * aren't actually associated with characters, but instead when they get sent 
 * to some place. Like a prison or something like that?
 * 
 * So think about how loZ does this with the use of the Dark World, right?

// We want to have a story guided by MICE. 
// Let's first start by opening up a character story!
// We need story data first.
// We have a beginning, middle, and end. So let's use these to be the driving 
// action in terms of making new MICE connections. Don't forget that you can 
// do a fractal story telling thing. Where each start can be interlaced 
// properly. You just have to close out the stories correctly. Locations 
// matter. Notice how you have the cake realm and the ovenless realm. Are 
// stories locked into these realms? Do you need to resolve them first?
// Does going into the middle bit increase story intensity?
