--How did we progress in Those Who Steal The Stars?
    StoryProgres == Narrative position + Spatial location
        Where you are in the story and where you are in the world.
Story = Arc
Arc = chapters
chapters = scenes
scenes = beats

ABLAgent should care about stories.

---End Goal---
Have an AI author that creates stories that adhere to MICE constraints.

The agent itself, however, will need to know two things. 
[1.]  The first being story beats. Such as a simple character story.
[2.] The second thing the agent will need is a model of MICE.

What are we missing:
- Story nodes.
    These story nodes need some kind of tag within them, so we know what we are kind of stories they are.
- Model of MICE.

C --> Resolution.

While each of the structures is effectively the same, the progression of those structures is different. So, a character storyline progresses whenever the character reflects on something.

An event story line progresses when the event has changed.

An inquiry story line progresses when a question has either been raised or answered. 

A milieu story line progresses when the characters are getting closer to leaving the location. Note, a milieu feels like a collection of inquiry questions. 

The key here is that progress must be made in some form. Each beat is a step towards a resolution.


TODO: NOW let's just code a scene where we have some reactive beats.
Character wants [change in life.]

life changing event.

Character reflects (we will want to use other systems for this.)
