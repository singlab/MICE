Welcome
This is a demo focusing on a computational model of MICE.

For the actual narrative, it's just something whipped up to get the point across that was written in a fugue state. 

-> Start

=== Start ===
~ state = "Start"
# Start of the story
Umbral darkness stretches itself over me as the starship flies over. I wonder what story of blight lives within those desecrated halls. But as the ink-stained ship passes through, the shadow disappearing, the vivid red of a skyline tarnished by technology presents itself to me.

As the siren screams its shrill song once more, I grab at a memory, when these skies were a verdant ocean of blues and greens. But I should purge the reminders of the past from my mind. I can't waste time, now. 

*** Find out more about the spaceships. (Inquiry) -> Spaceship_questions
*** Ruminate on the past. (Character) -> Questioning_the_past

=== Spaceship_questions
~ state = "Spaceship_questions"
# InquiryStart
# Location : Archtorrent
Working throughout the day, a question comes to me: Why are these ships here?

So, I ask a friendâ€”well, more of an acquaintance. 

He looks at me with a sadness in his gaze. "Those are the necromancers."

*** Necromancers -> an_answer

=== an_answer
~ state = "begin"
# InquiryContinue
He nods his head. "Aye. Necromancers. Foulest of the undying empire. A dark blight upon our common race. A manifestation of a bleak future, if you ask me."

He shrugs his shoulders. "But they control the land."

*** Say nothing  -> Event_start
*** Ask a follow up -> An_end_to_questions

=== Event_start
~ state = "EventStart"
# Event Start
Something happens that disrupts the flow of the narrative.
-> event_end

=== event_end
~ state = "EventEnd"
# Event End
Weird extra sentence for padding... I don't know why.

A darkness burst forth around us, scaring even me. 


*** Run from the darkness -> Avoiding_void
*** Restart the game (Debug) -> Epilogue

=== Avoiding_void
~ state = "Running away"
I run away from the darkness. It chases after me.

*** Escape by hiding -> stowaway
*** Confront the darkness -> confront_violence

=== stowaway
~ state = "Hiding" 
I hid myself in an open crate, letting the darkness pass by me. 
I wasn't scared so much as I was curious. Why did it chase me? (Opening an inquiry thread).
-> Back_to_the_friend

=== confront_violence
~ state = "talking to darkness"
The darkness passed by me, leaving me wondering one thing. Why? (Inquiry thread should open.)
-> Back_to_the_friend

=== Back_to_the_friend
~ state = "conversation continue"
I returned to my friend. 

"So," he said. "You got the mark."

*** What do you mean? -> An_end_to_questions
** Say nothing -> cold_shoulder

=== cold_shoulder
~ state = "Cold shoulder"
My friend looked me over, his eyes discerning. Then he shook his head. "You're more trouble than you're worth."

-> Epilogue

=== An_end_to_questions
~ state = "InquiryEnd"
# InquiryEnd
FILLER TEXT FOR DEMO END. 
-> Epilogue

=== Questioning_the_past
~ state = "CharacterStart"
# Location: Hedrift's home.

When I was young, not wrinkled by time and leathered by the sun, I was known as Hedrift. Yet, now I am known as the Fourth. 

-> Epilogue

=== Epilogue
~ state = "Epilogue"
# Epilogue
Thank you for playing!
-> END

NOTES:
    The computational version of MICE will have a try cycle per choice.
-> END
    Choices are try cycles within the narrative. (So now the narrative is about how much you try things? One possibility.)
