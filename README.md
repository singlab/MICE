#  MICE

## Project goals

This project focuses on creating showcase of how author techniques like MICE can lead to procedural consistency within an interactive narrative.

### Prerequisites
But to *actually* play the demo, please install [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) or any Java IDE. (We used Eclipse for this project because JetBeans alludes me.)

### Installation

1. Clone this repositroy: 

`git clone git@github.com:singlab/MICE.git`

2. Through Eclipse, navigate to ABL/ACU-agent directory and open within Eclipse.

3. Afterwards, navigate to the src/Runner directory.

4. Run the StoryRunner.java through the Eclipse IDE.

5. At this point, run the Unity MICE Protoype application within Unity/Build

### Notes
Please do **not** use the runnable jar within abl/build. It will create a thread that will not terminate. Currently working on this.
